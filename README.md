# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
The main goals of this analysis are:
- To create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
- To show total weekly fares for each city type. 
- Finally, to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

The summary DataFrame is:

Key Findings:
- Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
- Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.
- Suburban cities have 6x + drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and per driver.

Key Findings:
- While Urban & Rural fares dip in the last 2 weeks, we can se the suburban fares increasing.

# Summary

Based on this data, a recommendations to Pyber decision-makers could be to increase the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand, where average fares are higher, probably due to larger trips.
